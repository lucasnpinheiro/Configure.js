Configure.js
============

Javascript method that behaves somewhat similar to CakePHPs `Configure` class;
http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/configuration.html#configure-class
https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/lib/Cake/Core/Configure.php

It's used for storing global configuration, that does not pollute global scope, in an easy accessible way.

See `testsSpec.js` for examples.
